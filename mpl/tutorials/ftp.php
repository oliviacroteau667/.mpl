            <h1>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h1>    

            <p> FTP stands for "File Transfer Protocol." It is a network protocol and a 
                command-line tool used for transferring files between a local computer 
                and a remote server over a network. FTP is often used for non-secure 
                file transfers, as it does not provide encryption for data transmission.
            </p>

            <h3>Example Syntax</h3>
            <p>
                localuser > ftp example.server.com <br>
                Connected to example.server.com    <br>
                User (example.server.com): <br>
            </p>
