.mpl is a UNIX survival guide in website format, complete with tutorials and interactive practice exercises.
NOTE: this website is no longer hosted, however the design document has been included for visual understanding.

Each topic section explains how a UNIX command would be used, and many of them have an embedded terminal enviroment. A prompt asks the user to type the syntax necessary to complete a task in UNIX. The user input is string checked against the correct answer for that problem, which is stored in a MySQL database. If the user is incorrect the animation enviroment will highlight red. If they enter the correct string then it will highlight green and an animation will play to visualize the effect of that command. 

This website is fully mobile friendly and made modular using PHP.
